# Migrations

This directory is meant to house a historical record of migration documentation
and utilities between versions. Migration information will be available for the previous five (5) versions.

As a 0-versioned application, minor version releases may include significant breaking changes or security improvements. We therefore highly recommend running the latest version of Vela for the best experience.
