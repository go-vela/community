## Background

<!--
This section is intended to describe the new feature, redesign or refactor.
-->

**Please provide a summary of the new feature, redesign or refactor:**

<!--
Provide your description here.
-->

With the implementation of the `internal/token` package in the `v0.18.0` release, there is an opportunity to further improve the security of worker-server communication. As it stands today, the worker uses a symmetric token (worker: `VELA_SERVER_SECRET`, server: `VELA_SECRET`) to authenticate the [check-in routine](https://github.com/go-vela/worker/blob/main/cmd/vela-worker/register.go). 

This document is a proposal to utilize the recently introduced `internal/token` package to mint and validate worker auth tokens and include a registration process to introduce significant friction for potential attackers.

In short, the Vela platform administrators will have the ability to register workers with a registration token, and the worker will maintain its authenticity by performing a check-in at a specified interval, where it will present its authentication token and receive a new one. The details of this will all be included below, in the [Design](03-12_worker-auth.md#design) section.

This feature is intended to be optional. If platform admins would rather continue to use the symmetric token for the check in process as well as getting build tokens, that will be available.


**Please briefly answer the following questions:**

1. Why is this required?

<!-- Answer here -->

In the current implementation, the server-worker symmetric token has no expiration and is not encrypted in any way. 

If a bad actor were to gain access to the host on which the Vela worker is run, they could read from the docker environment and use the symmetric secret to request build tokens, update worker information, and spin up new workers of their own.

2. If this is a redesign or refactor, what issues exist in the current implementation?

<!-- Answer here -->

Mentioned in question 1

3. Are there any other workarounds, and if so, what are the drawbacks?

<!-- Answer here -->

While there may be other forms of authentication available for the server and worker, there already exists the infrastructure to use JWT tokens with claims on expiration, token type, etc.

4. Are there any related issues? Please provide them below if any exist.

<!-- Answer here -->

N/A

## Design

<!--
This section is intended to explain the solution design for the proposal.

NOTE: If there are no current plans for a solution, please leave this section blank.
-->

**Please describe your solution to the proposal. This includes, but is not limited to:**

* new/updated endpoints or url paths
* new/updated configuration variables (environment, flags, files, etc.)
* performance and user experience trade-offs
* security concerns or assumptions
* examples or (pseudo) code snippets

<!-- Answer here -->

A diagram will be added to this proposal soon to provide a visual aid for the design.

### Server Design

With the implementation of the token manager and build tokens, the ground work is already present to mint and validate worker auth tokens.

Some of the major changes will be:

- Add the ability for the `internal/token` package to mint and validate worker auth / register tokens
- Add a `POST` registration endpoint, which will be platform admin exclusive. It will return a worker registration token.
- Enhance the current `MustWorker` permissions check to use claims from a worker auth token with the option of also using the symmetric secret, if provided. 
- Place the `POST` and `PUT` worker endpoints behind that improved permissions check. (note: the `PUT` endpoint will accept both registration and auth tokens in order to account for re-registration in the event the worker was offline and is still in the database. It will also accept user access token types from platform admins that want to perform an update on the worker).
- Add a `GET` validate token endpoint. One of the drawbacks of using HMAC token signing is the fact that there is no way to check validity of any given token without it being parsed by the entity with the private key (in this case, the server). By adding a simple endpoint that validates a token came from the server the worker expected, we will be able to verify tokens from the server to the worker (e.g. canceling a build).

### Worker Design

The worker design is more tricky, but will look something like this:

1. On start up, the worker will enter a dead loop, where it will do nothing (no pulling from queue, checking in, etc) except serve the worker API. It will then be the job of the platform administrators to "register" the worker by hitting the worker's self registration endpoint.
2. Once the self-registration endpoint is hit, the worker will use the token gathered from the header of that incoming request and break its dead loop, thereby entering its check in loop and exec loop.
3-a. During the check in process, the worker will exchange its registration token for an auth token, which it will then refresh on the check-in interval. The success status of the check in will be a new struct field for the worker.
3-b. Based on the success status, the worker will proceed with its exec loop, checking before each pull whether the worker is truly verified with the server.
4. When a build is pulled off the queue, the worker will request a build token using its auth token.
5. In a scenario where a worker loses connection for a certain time period that renders the auth token expired, and admin must re-register the worker.

Other considerations to further improve security:
- specification of IP address in the claims to allow restriction by IP
- stricter expiration logic

In the case where the admins would prefer to continue using the symmetric token, all the above worker design logic will use the `VELA_SERVER_SECRET` token, which will not expire and not hinder executors' ability to pull from the queue.

### CLI Design

Since the registration token is so quick to expire, it is important to automate the job of onboarding workers for platform admins. This means that a new CLI command will be added that will use platform admin credentials to retrieve a registration token and hit the worker self-register endpoint. This will be vital for use in automation tools.

### Other things of note

- The server secret would be dropped from the container environment altogether if platform admins opt in to this enhancement.
- All auth tokens (check in + registration) have a strict expiration.
- Registration tokens can only be generated by a platform administrator
- Registration tokens should expire very quickly
- The callback to the server to validate the token is a bit clumsy. This could be improved greatly by using private-public key pairs rather than a single HMAC private key. Future enhancement? Must-have for MVP?
