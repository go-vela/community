for rc1:

## Story 1: (external) cut v0.x.0-rc1
## Timing
Can be concurrent with stories 2 and 3

## Background
This cuts the go-vela external (pre-release) rc1 https://pages.git.target.com/rapid/doc-site/13-vela/upgrades/#external
https://github.com/go-vela/server/releases (similar for types, sdk-go, worker, cli, ui)
fyi, ui can be released separately, so is currently n+1 version (server 14, ui 15)



## Story 2: (external) prep draft pr for release notes
## Timing
Can be concurrent with stories 1 and 3

## Background
pr sometimes combined with migration tool, but could still be separate story
https://github.com/go-vela/community/pull/591



## Story 3 (external) prep draft pr for migration tool
## Timing
Can be concurrent with stories 1 and 2

## Background
pr sometimes combined with release notes, but could still be separate story
migration tool often necessary for database changes
simple, if there is no migration tool necessary for this release like https://github.com/go-vela/community/pull/439 (fyi, this one combined with release notes)
more involved, if there is a migration tool like https://github.com/go-vela/community/pull/592



## Story 4: (internal) release rc1 to dev / run dev vela-canary tests
##Timing
After Story 3 (external)

## Action
https://pages.git.target.com/rapid/doc-site/13-vela/upgrades/#internal and 
specifically https://pages.git.target.com/rapid/doc-site/13-vela/upgrades/#dev

https://vela.dev.target.com/vela-canary/all-repo restart a build => results in all the other canary repos kicking off a build near the same time (a good way to watch them all is https://vela.dev.target.com/vela-canary/builds)



## Story 5: (internal) test rc1 in dev
##Timing
After Step 4 (internal)

##Action
manually test any new bug fixes / enhancements / features
look for bugs
add vela-canary modifications/additions to story 7



## Story 6: (external) rc1 bugs
## Background
keeping 1 story for the sake of this summary exercise; could be 1 where we link all bugs external bugs, or separate stories 1 per bug



## Story 7: (internal) add/modify / validate canary tests
## Background
keeping 1 story for the sake of this summary exercise; could be 1 or several stories for a single release flow
either split by add/modify vs validate, or split by canary test, or keep 1 long-running story for entire release process, or by bug/enhancement/feature (this way is gross), orâ€¦hmm



for rc2+ (if needed):
equivalent stories 1, 4, 5, 6; review 2, 3, 7 for any pertinent changes
