## v0.11.0

Happy November Vela Community!

Thank you to everyone for trying Vela! This new release contains a MAJOR repo consolidation from 11 core repos down to 6!

This [repo consolidation proposal](https://github.com/go-vela/community/blob/master/proposals/2021/08-25_repo-structure) was implemented, resulting in these go-vela repos to be archived:

  * [compiler](https://github.com/go-vela/compiler)
  * [pkg-executor](https://github.com/go-vela/pkg-executor)
  * [pkg-runtime](https://github.com/go-vela/pkg-runtime)
  * [pkg-queue](https://github.com/go-vela/pkg-queue)
  * [mock](https://github.com/go-vela/mock)

The above repo content was [refactored](https://github.com/go-vela/community/blob/master/releases/v0.11.md/#refactor) into these repos:

  * [server](https://github.com/go-vela/server)
  * [worker](https://github.com/go-vela/worker)
  * [sdk-go](https://github.com/go-vela/sdk-go)
  * [cli](https://github.com/go-vela/cli)

Special shoutout and thanks to Cargill and kneal for their assistance with the repo consolidation / refactor, as well as others in the community for their contributions to a number of stories!
