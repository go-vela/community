## v0.18.0

Greetings, Vela Community!

Below is a summary of what's new in 0.18.0.

### Breaking Changes

#### Platform Admin

- Admins now must provide a `VELA_SERVER_PRIVATE_KEY` value to their server environment. See [build token proposal](https://github.com/go-vela/community/blob/main/proposals/2023/02-23_build-tokens.md) for more information. There is also further documentation [here](https://go-vela.github.io/docs/installation/server/reference/#vela_server_private_key)
- `VELA_ACCESS_TOKEN_DURATION` changed to `VELA_USER_ACCESS_TOKEN_DURATION`
- `VELA_REFRESH_TOKEN_DURATION` changed to `VELA_USER_REFRESH_TOKEN_DURATION`
  * feat(auth)!: build token implementation by @ecrupper in https://github.com/go-vela/server/pull/765

#### Users

- The default clone image used for checking out repositories from `git` was updated from a hardcoded `target/vela-git:v0.5.1` to `target/vela-git:v0.7.0@sha256:c2e8794556d6debceeaa2c82ff3cc9e8e6ed045b723419e3ff050409f25cc258` (now configurable by your Vela platform administrator). The update contains a change that could yield unexpected behavior or, in the worst case, breaking builds. See the [`vela-git` v0.7.0 release notes](https://github.com/go-vela/vela-git/releases/tag/v0.7.0) for more information.
