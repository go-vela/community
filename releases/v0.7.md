### Breaking Changes

Authentication now comes with a configurable expiration (8hr Refresh Tokens with 15m Access Tokens by default). The following scenarios will require you to [create a GitHub Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) and perform the respective actions:

* Using CLI in automation:
  * Ensure you are using `v0.7.2` or later of the CLI, whether direct binary or docker image, eg. `target/vela-cli:v0.7.2`.
  * Supply the Personal Access Token that was created via `VELA_TOKEN` environment variable or `--api.token` flag.

* Using the [vela-downstream plugin](https://github.com/go-vela/vela-downstream):
  * Ensure you are using `v0.4.0` or later of the plugin.
  * Supply the Personal Access Token that was created via `DOWNSTREAM_TOKEN` environment variable or `token` parameter.

_Note: the Personal Access Token should have the following scopes: `repo`, `repo:status`, `user:email`, `read:user`, and `read:org`_

### Features

* Cancel a running build via the UI/CLI/API
* Add expiration to auth
* Support for writing templates in [Starlark](https://github.com/bazelbuild/starlark) (dialect of python) language
* New Pipeline management endpoints:
