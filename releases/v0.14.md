Happy June, Vela Community!

This new release contains breaking changes, bug fixes, enhancements to existing features and new features!

Below is a summary of what's new in 0.14.0

### Breaking Changes

#### User:

- The CI environment variable default value has been changed to a boolean defaulting to `true`; thus aligning with env var `CI` implementation across many other CI tools. `CI` env var was previously a string defaulting to `vela`. See [Change Default Value of "CI" Environment Variable](https://github.com/go-vela/community/issues/554).
  * user (server) enhance!: modify CI environment value to true in [619](https://github.com/go-vela/server/pull/619)
- Changes in permissions for pipeline endpoints. Endpoints available at `/api/v1/pipelines/:org/:repo/..` now require appropriate permissions to access. At a minimum, `read` permissions to the repo that contains the pipeline. For details, please see: https://github.com/go-vela/server/blob/v0.14.2/router/pipeline.go#L30-L44

#### Platform Admin:

- Mitigate `missing repo_id` errors in logs. See [Database update hook errors on repository events](https://github.com/go-vela/community/issues/586). Requires use of the [Migration Utility](#for-vela-administrators).
  * (server) fix(hook/webhook)!: clean up rename repo code with EventAction and shift defer func [641](https://github.com/go-vela/server/pull/641)

- Pipelines are now a "first-class citizen", and will be stored in the database. See [add official support for pipelines](https://github.com/go-vela/community/issues/460). Requires use of the [Migration Utility](#for-vela-administrators).
  * (server) feat(api)!: add support for pipelines in [615](https://github.com/go-vela/server/pull/615)
