Greetings, Vela Community!

This new release is a security-focused release that addresses some default settings and introduces a new enhancement. It contains fixes for [CVE-2022-39395](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-39395).

### Breaking Changes

#### Platform Admin:

##### go-vela/server

The behavior of the `VELA_REPO_ALLOWLIST` (https://go-vela.github.io/docs/installation/server/reference/#vela_repo_allowlist) setting on the `go-vela/server` component has changed. Previously, an empty list (the default setting) would allow anyone with a GitHub account to add a repository to a connected Vela installation. With this release, the default remains an empty list, but now honors the empty list by not allowing any repository to be enabled. Administrators will have to opt in the repositories they intend to allow to be enabled for their installation. To note, a Vela admin can provide a value of `*` to allow any repository to be enabled. This is equivalent to the prior behavior with the empty list value.

* (server): modify allowlist, default pull request to false [05558ee99d70f7d6f83bed7c8f78ac0b35fa26f4](https://github.com/go-vela/server/commit/05558ee99d70f7d6f83bed7c8f78ac0b35fa26f4)

##### go-vela/worker

The value for `VELA_RUNTIME_PRIVILEGED_IMAGES` (https://go-vela.github.io/docs/installation/worker/reference/#vela_runtime_privileged_images) previously defaulted to `target/vela-docker`, allowing that plugin to be run in privileged mode. In this release, the default value is empty. Vela admins will have to opt in for any plugin to be allowed to run in privileged mode by providing a list for any allowed plugins in this setting.

* (worker): don't supply default privileged image [a40039059d713c96275c0427a695a09f79195f29](https://github.com/go-vela/worker/commit/a40039059d713c96275c0427a695a09f79195f29)

Previously, the `trusted` field in Vela for Repositories was unused. In this release, Vela admins can leverage the `trusted` field to control which repositories are allowed to run plugins in privileged mode. Only Vela admins can toggle this flag per repository. Only when a repository has the `trusted` field set to `true` and the plugin is listed in `VELA_RUNTIME_PRIVILEGED_IMAGES` will that plugin be able to run in privileged mode. It is recommended that Vela admins ensure that all currently enabled repositories in their Vela installation have the `trusted` field set to the appropriate setting. Vela admins can toggle the `trusted` field value through the update repo endpoint on the api (see https://go-vela.github.io/docs/reference/api/repo/update/). This feature can be toggled on the `go-vela/worker` component via the `VELA_EXECUTOR_ENFORCE_TRUSTED_REPOS` flag. The default value for this is `true`.

#### Users:

Prior to this release, newly enabled repositories automatically enabled the `push` and `pull_request` events. With this release, only the `push` event will be enabled when repositories are enabled. Users will have to opt in to `pull_request` events. In the UI, a new notice will appear to notify users of potential security implications of enabling `pull_request` events for their repository.

* (server): modify allowlist, default pull request to false [05558ee99d70f7d6f83bed7c8f78ac0b35fa26f4](https://github.com/go-vela/server/commit/05558ee99d70f7d6f83bed7c8f78ac0b35fa26f4)
* (ui): add pull request language [885efce30b84486357554eadef9c5fec84011c6c][https://github.com/go-vela/ui/commit/885efce30b84486357554eadef9c5fec84011c6c]

Builds in this release may fail if a plugin was expected to run in privileged mode (such as the `target/vela-docker` plugin). Work with your Vela platform administrators to adjust the `trusted` setting on your repository.
