## v0.5.0

Thank you to everyone for trying Vela! This new release contains bug fixes, enhancements to existing features and new features!

### Breaking Changes

The `~/.vela/config.yml` has received some quality of life changes updating the syntax to use Yaml nodes (objects). The change looks like:

```diff
- addr: https://vela.company.com
- token: someUserToken1234

+ api:
+   addr: https://vela.company.com
+   token: someUserToken1234
```

When you upgrade to the new CLI `brew upgrade vela` the fix is to regenerate the config with your existing config values. Commands you'll need:

1. `vela view config`
2. `vela generate config --api.addr https://vela.company.com --api.token <token_value>`

### Features

* Secret plugin integration with Enterprise Vault:
  * New Vault plugin with feature
  * New secret syntax to support running secret plugins
* JSON schema for improved pipeline writing in editors
* Open API spec documentation for server endpoints
* Open API spec documentation for worker endpoints
* Add the ability to skip a incoming webhook. i.e. `CI SKIP`

### Enhancements

* Impose character limit on number of starred repositories
* Vela build workspace moving from `/home` to `/vela`
* Set the GitHub deployment status on `deployment` events
* Skip icon to easily identify skipped steps
* Ansi decoder decoding for log output (Colorized logs)
* Improve table responsiveness for secrets and hooks
* Displaying commit message on build overview page

The following plugins have been updated to read parameters from files for external secrets:

* Artifactory
* Cache
* Docker
* Downstream
* Git
* Slack
* NPM
* SSH
