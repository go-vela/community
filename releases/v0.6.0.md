# v0.6.0

Thank you to everyone for trying Vela! This new release contains bug fixes, enhancements to existing features and new features!

#### Breaking Changes notes:

With the new pull policy changes steps, services, or secret containing `pull: true` will be converted into `pull: always` during compile time.

It is **strongly recommended** customers read the [documentation](https://go-vela.github.io/docs/usage/getting-started/pull_policies/) to identify if it's necessary to tell Vela to pull. Once you have identified the new policy that will work for you modify your pipeline with one of the new available pull policies types. 

#### Features:

* new `pull` policy options for images within pipelines:
  * `always` - policy type for a service, secret or step to always pull an image.
  * `not_present` - policy type for a service, secret or step to only pull an image if it doesn't exist.
  * `on_start` - policy type for a service, secret or step to only pull an image before the container starts.
  * `never` - policy type for a service, secret or step to never pull an image.
* new log actions while viewing log output:
  * jump to bottom
  * jump to top
  * download logs

#### Enhancements:

* update bool flags in CLI to be strings
* add ability to tail logs
* tweak step log presentation
* enhanced secret breadcrumb navigation
* refactor `add-repositories` page to be `source-repositories` and include all repos instead of admin only ones

#### Bug Fixes:

* fix JSON schema requiring stages to have a field name
* properly set default value for `allow_command` field within secrets
* correct CLI flag syntax usage in init log output
* fix issue with improperly configured alternative secret naming was exposing secrets
* fix race condition causing builds to error with `pq: duplicate key value violates`
* fix bug causing commit messages with special characters to crash workers
* fix init logs not showing image hashes
