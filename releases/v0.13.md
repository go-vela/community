Happy March Vela Community!

This new release contains breaking changes, bug fixes, enhancements to existing features and new features!

Below is a summary of what's new in 0.13.0

### Breaking Changes to Secrets

* (types) fix(secret)!: remove implicit repo secrets and clean up secrets testing [230](https://github.com/go-vela/types/pull/230)

  Implicit Vela repo secrets have been deprecated. All Vela repo secrets will need to be written declaratively in your pipeline.

  ```diff
    # Implicit repo secret definition (deprecated).
    - name: foo

    # Declarative repo secret definition.
    - name: foo
      # syntax: <org>/<repo>/<secret name>
  +   key: github/octocat/foo
  +   engine: native
  +   type: repo
  ```
  
  Please see [our docs on the syntax for secrets](https://go-vela.github.io/docs/usage/secrets/#internal-secrets) to learn more information
