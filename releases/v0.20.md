# v0.20 üöÄ

This document contains all release notes pertaining to the `v0.20.x` releases of Vela.

## For Vela Administrators

- When upgrading from `v0.19`, please take note of the [migration information](/migrations/v0.20/README.md)
- You can control access to the new scheduling functionality by supplying a list of org/repos into the `VELA_SCHEDULE_ALLOWLIST` flag. `<org>/*` will allow all repositories within the given org access to the schedule functionality. `*` allows anyone access. Please note, you will want to supply this flag to both the `server` and `ui` components.

## v0.20.3

Bug fixes in the API, CLI, and secret handling for schedules.

- (types) patch(v0.20.2/secrets): allow schedule event type [#311](https://github.com/go-vela/types/pull/311)
- (server) patch(webhook): support transfer and rename [#959](https://github.com/go-vela/server/pull/959)
- (server) patch(api/build): add commit to compiler instantiation [#960](https://github.com/go-vela/server/pull/960)
- (server) patch(sync): address sync bug with update webhook call [#962](https://github.com/go-vela/server/pull/962)
- (cli) patch(v0.20.2/secrets): support schedule event for secrets [#476](https://github.com/go-vela/cli/pull/476)
- (ui) patch(v0.21.1/secrets): allow schedules for secret form if on allowlist [#719](https://github.com/go-vela/ui/pull/719)

## v0.20.2

This release contains all the bug fixes specified in `v0.20.3`, but it also reverts a bug fix that was done in `v0.20.1`. This was a mistake. 

This version is still viable, but users will experience issues running [the validate command](https://go-vela.github.io/docs/reference/cli/pipeline/validate/) with local templates if they are leveraging [nested templates](https://go-vela.github.io/docs/templates/#nested-templates).

We recommend users take advantage of the rectified version `v0.20.3` but will leave this version available for posterity.

## v0.20.1

Fixes an issue with nested template validation in the CLI.

- (cli) fix(pipeline): set max template depth and adjust CompileLite call [#467](https://github.com/go-vela/cli/pull/467)
- (server) fix(compiler): convert local templates to an engine field for nested templates [#916](https://github.com/go-vela/server/pull/916)
- (server) patch(compiler): put local templates into the compiler engine struct [#917](https://github.com/go-vela/server/pull/917)

## v0.20.0

### üí• Breaking Changes

#### Platform Admin:

- Builds that were queued before a Vela upgrade or downgrade will be invalidated if the two Vela versions between worker and server do not share the same queue ItemVersion.
    - (types) feat!: protect against stale queue items [#292](https://github.com/go-vela/types/commit/35a0d5fc088caee432b68ee9166cfc6deceb6ef8) - thanks [@cognifloyd](https://github.com/cognifloyd)!
    - (worker) feat!: Use queue Item.ItemVersion field to fail stale builds [#478](https://github.com/go-vela/worker/commit/1ff33a7f957ea46d14038fa52baf37dd682d4e1e) - thanks [@cognifloyd](https://github.com/cognifloyd)!
- The release updates the default clone image to `vela-git:v0.8.0` which includes a breaking change in how pull requests are checked out during the `clone` step. This [clone image can be overridden](https://go-vela.github.io/docs/installation/server/reference/#vela_clone_image) by platform admins via the `VELA_CLONE_IMAGE` flag:
    - fix!: branch setup for git init in [#138](https://github.com/go-vela/vela-git/pull/138)

#### Users:

- The release updates the default clone image to `vela-git:v0.8.0` which includes a breaking change in how pull requests are checked out. If your installation does not use a custom clone image for the `clone` step, the checkout behavior for pull requests will be slightly different and can cause certain pipelines to behave in an unexpected way.
    - fix!: branch setup for git init in [#138](https://github.com/go-vela/vela-git/pull/138)
