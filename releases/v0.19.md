- Please review an updated version of the [Worker registration documentation](https://go-vela.github.io/docs/installation/worker/docker/#step-2-determine-worker-authentication-and-start-worker)

## v0.19.2

Reverts an upgrade to envsubst library due to issues substituting certain secret values.

- (types) revert(envsubst): rolling back upgrade to envsubst library due to errors in handling multiline json keys [#286](https://github.com/go-vela/types/pull/286) - thanks [@ecrupper](https://github.com/ecrupper)!
- (server) revert(envsubst): roll back envsubst library upgrade due to multiline secret errors [#838](https://github.com/go-vela/server/pull/838) - thanks [@ecrupper](https://github.com/ecrupper)!

## v0.19.1

- (sdk-go) fix(version): adjust to use correct version [#228](https://github.com/go-vela/sdk-go/commit/6a63f8c00bcd0b08a4dc911d2d79d28879779f25) - thanks [@wass3rw3rk](https://github.com/wass3rw3rk)!


## v0.19.0

### 💥 Breaking Changes

#### Platform Admin:

- Admins will need to run the migration script to add a new field to the repo object.
    - (server) enhance(repo)!: add topics field to build env and repo [#807](https://github.com/go-vela/server/commit/676edd65e0cc89a0b1a75616f23f6a55de317393) - thanks [@ecrupper](https://github.com/ecrupper)!

#### Users

- Users will be notified via error message if their repo is associated with a user that has insufficient access in GitHub. Any impacted users can utilize Vela's "Chown" feature (via UI or [CLI](https://go-vela.github.io/docs/reference/cli/repo/chown/)) using a currently valid GitHub admin user for their repo.
    - (server) enhance(webhook)!: verify repo owner has at least write access to SCM repo [#811](https://github.com/go-vela/server/commit/00e378dd33ec19396f7c3b59c4d9c744244f7363) - thanks [@ecrupper](https://github.com/ecrupper)!

Note: The following change exists in v0.19.0 but was reverted in [v0.19.2](#v0192).
- ~In certain scenarios, it's possible that the contents of a payload coming from GitHub contain certain characters that the compiler can't handle. A library dealing with variable substitution (which populates variables from GitHub webhook payloads) has been upgraded. While no issues were detected during testing, this is marked as breaking in a precautionary way.~
    - ~(server) fix(compiler)!: webhook payload containing message with special characters causes failure [#793](https://github.com/go-vela/server/commit/3fec46cbef8ae8224d7cad31680e96e4b5513498) - thanks [@NickHackman](https://github.com/NickHackman)!~
