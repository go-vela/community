# v0.5.1

Thank you to everyone for trying Vela! This new release contains bug fixes, enhancements to existing features and new features!

#### Breaking Changes notes:

The `~/.vela/config.yml` has received some quality of life changes updating the syntax to use Yaml nodes (objects). The change looks like:

```diff
- addr: https://vela-server.prod.target.com
- token: someUserToken2034

+ api:
+   addr: https://vela-server.prod.target.com
+   token: someUserToken2034
```

When you upgrade to the new CLI `brew upgrade vela` the fix is to regenerate the config with your existing config values. Commands you'll need:

1. `vela view config`
2. `vela generate config --api.addr https://vela-server.prod.target.com --api.token <token_value>`

#### Enhancements:

* Re-designed CLI with improvements to all commands
  * The `vela validate` command has now been renamed to `vela validate pipeline`
  * `vela get hooks` and `vela view hook` are new commands
  * `vela generate completion` for bash and zsh auto completion
  * The new output flag allowing you to customize the output being displayed from a command 
  * better environment variable support for most, if not all, CLI commands
  * New command `vela get logs` for seeing logs
* Line number in logs to be right aligned
* Moving commit information above event details
* A new set of environment variables with `VELA_` prefix
* All Atlas templates had their default images updated to latest tag

#### Bug Fixes:

* Whitespace bug fix for UI
* JSON Schema will recognize template steps correctly
* Regression with causing downstream stages to not fail
* Regression with causing rulest status to perform incorrectly
